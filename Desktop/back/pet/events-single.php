						<p style="color:cornsilk;">Instead of going for your usual weekend morning stroll why not take part in a Fun With Dogs Treasure Hunt with your dog.
						Doggy Treasure Hunts take place throughout the year in numerous locations around the South, both in towns and cities as well as more rural locations.Your team consists of one or two dogs and as many humans as you like. If you have two dogs in your family why not split into two teams and compete against each other.	At the starting point you will be given a sheet of clues. Your team then follow the clues and complete some simple Doggy Challenges around the route. </p>

					Each dog must complete the challenges before you can continue the Hunt.... if you have two dogs in your team this means both dogs must complete the challenges before you move on. Be one of the first three teams home and win a prize!! All participating teams will receive a goodie bag for completing the hunt. No special skills required. Designed to be completed in an hour so suitable for most dogs over 9 months of age. Maximum of 30 teams, but no maximum number of participants.
